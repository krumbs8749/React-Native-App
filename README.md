# React Native Job Search App

Welcome to the React Native Job Search App! This mobile application, built with Expo, serves as a versatile template for various application development needs. The app allows users to search for nearby and popular jobs based on their search queries. It is currently configured to send API requests to a local server created with Spring Java, using demo data. Additionally, it has the potential to connect to external APIs, such as jsearch on RapidApi, for real job listings.
